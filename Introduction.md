# Nature of the topic: 

Winning in the stock market has traditionally involved complex mathematical modeling and expensive computer simulations. Data science is already widespread in the financial world, with applications including market trend forecasting, customer segmentation, fraud detection, risk analysis, predictive analytics, and customer sentiment analysis. In this project, we will use data science to produce a multipurpose investment recommendation platform. With our help, investors will not need to be an analyst or own a supercomputer to win in the market. We will follow a multistep approach. First, we will choose a set of businesses and research their internal finance metrics such as revenue, debt-to-equity ratio (D/E), and free cash flow (FCF). Second, we will evaluate their worths using key metrics, including price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), price-to-book ratios (P/B), market caps, and growth trends. Finally, we will use text sources such as news articles and economic reports to perform sentiment analysis on their customers. After analyzing each aspect of these businesses, we will isolate the most relevant factors. Then using that information, we will create a platform that generates a profile with an investment score for a given business. The platform is aimed at three groups of people: investors, venture capitalists, and startups. Prospective investors will be able to input a list of publicly traded small businesses and easily decide which are good investments. Venture capitalists (VCs) will be able to input metrics from a startup pitch, and obtain a profile about the startup. Finally, startups will gain insights into key factors that should be prioritized for growth. 

# Why it is important: 

People who are interested in investing often have no idea where to start, or are intimidated by market volatility and the risk of losing money. Figuring out which companies are worth investing in is a time consuming and complicated ordeal. Many who have the courage and capital to invest do so blindly, with little more than intuition and trends guiding their decisions. Investing with little information often leads to poor returns. In his article, “Why It Is Hard To Invest”, Derek Hagen makes the point that our brains are not built for investing. He lists negativity bias, confirmation bias, status quo bias, hindsight bias, and illusion of control as the main reasons people lose in the market. We aim to remedy this with a data-driven approach that cuts out all the human error. We want our users to have an unbiased view of the market. Furthermore, we want to support entrepreneurship by offering a two-sided solution for VCs and startups alike. Entrepreneurial communities cultivate innovative and exciting new products.
